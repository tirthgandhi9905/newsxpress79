# Task B: Identification of Elicitation Techniques for each of the stakeholders.

# Stakeholders, How & Why

## End Users
- **How identified:** Direct users who interact with the system daily.  
- **Why important:** They determine the app’s success through usability, satisfaction, and engagement.  
- **Why these elicitation techniques:**
  - **Questionnaire:** Because we can get to know what features the user expects from the web-app.
  - **Naturalistic Observation/Ethnography:** Observing end users in their natural work environment is crucial for uncovering requirements that they may not think       to mention. This technique helps us to personalize their feed by examining the pattern of their interests.
  - **Interviews:** Interviews with end users allow for a one-on-one or group discussion to understand user expectations and needs. Through open-ended questions, you can gain deep insights and discover nuanced ideas. It also allows us to Record information to be used as input to requirements analysis and modeling, Discover information from interviewee accurately and efficiently and Reassure interviewee that his/her understanding of the topic has been explored, listened to, and valued.

---

## News Publishers
- **How identified:** Providers of the content that the system aggregates.  
- **Why important:** Ensure credibility, timeliness, and variety of content.  
- **Why these elicitation techniques:**
  - **Studying Document:** Reviewing existing publisher documentation, such as content style guides, API documentation, and Language, can provide valuable insights into their current processes.
---

## Developers
- **How identified:** Team responsible for building and implementing the system.  
- **Why important:** Ensure technical feasibility, scalability, and quality of implementation.  
- **Why these elicitation techniques:**
   - **Studying Documentation:** This technique involves creating detailed scenarios that describe how users interact with the system. Use cases are valuable for developers because they help identify system actors and the specific interactions needed to accomplish goals. This structured approach provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be built.
   - **Prototyping:** Prototyping allows developers to explore the feasibility of certain features and understand what a product should look like before a single line of code is written. It helps them visualize the requirements and ensures that the software design aligns with user expectations.
   - **Joint Application Design (JAD):** JAD is a technique that brings together stakeholders, including developers, in a collaborative workshop to define requirements and make decisions. This method helps to bridge the "expectation gap" and ensures that developers have a shared understanding of the project's goals.     - **Interviews:** Could help exploring the issue and solve them at the earliest while discussing with other developers and product manager.
   - **Questionnaire:** This technique will be helpful as it will help to gain insight on team's technical preferance or expertise.
   - **Brainstorming:** It is essential for generating creative, innovative technical solutions and helps identify potential technical challenges and risks before design and development begin.
---

## Product Manager
- **How identified:** Strategic leader responsible for product vision and roadmap.  
- **Why important:** Balance business goals and user needs, ensuring long-term success.  
- **Why these elicitation techniques:**
  - **Brainstorming:** Brainstorming helps the product manager and other stakeholders explore and define what the system should do and it helps to clarify the project's scope.
  - **Interviews:** Product managers can conduct interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, from end users to executive sponsors, to understand different perspectives and priorities. They should ask questions to clarify the "why" behind requirements to ensure the app provides true business value.
  - **Workshops:** Workshops are an effective way to facilitate group discussions and collaboration among different stakeholders. A product manager can lead workshops to brainstorm ideas, define project scope, and prioritize requirements based on business value and user needs.

---

## Test Engineers
- **How identified:** Quality assurance experts validating system behavior.  
- **Why important:** Ensure reliability, correctness, and security of the final product.  
- **Why these elicitation techniques:**
   - **Document Analysis:** Test engineers can review and analyze existing project documentation, such as requirement specifications and use cases, to understand the system's intended behavior. This technique provides a clear foundation for creating test plans and test cases.
   - **Interview:** It would help developers to know what the major bugs are in the system along with the vulnerability.
